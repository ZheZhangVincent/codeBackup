# Computer Vision: Household Object Recognition

This project is about how to use NLP and CV knowledge to perform household object recognition. It use open-cv library on python.

In this project, we use tf-idf, color histogram, and vector similarity model to computer similarities between different objects. 

The details of algorithm process is on [Household Object Recognition][1]. The main program is [main program][2], and we can modify arguments in it to optimize the whole process. In this algorithm, the k-value is an important argument cause it decided that how many classes of vectors it will have.
