This solver can handle problems with enumerated variables with finite domains.

It allows binary and unary constraints as well as alldiff and allsame constraints.

These files have the following format.

Lines starting with var, define a number of variables and their domains.
For example:

    var QLD NSW VIC ACT SA : red green blue

will create the variables QLD NSW VIC ACT and SA and give them all the
domain red, green, blue.

It is possible to specify arbitrary binary constraints as follows:

    con WA NT : red green : red blue : green red : green blue : blue red : blue green
    
This says that the variables WA and NT can take one of the listed pairs
of values.

Unary constraints are possible and are handled by preprocessing:

    con NT : red : blue

This constraint will restrict the domain of NT to red and blue before search begins.

There are also some more constraints, which the solver will compile into normal
binary constraints.

The alldiff constraint indicates that all of the variables in the list must have
different values. For example:

    alldiff ACT NSW SA
    
The allsame constraint ndicates that all of the variables in the list must have
the same value. For example:

    allsame ACT NSW WA
